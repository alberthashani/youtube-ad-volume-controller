# YouTube Ad Volume Controller | Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension automatically detects when ads start and end, adjusting the volume to a user-defined level. By allowing users to set a specific volume for ads, it creates a consistent and comfortable listening experience without sudden loud interruptions. Ads often play at a higher volume than regular videos, which can be quite annoying. This discrepancy in volume levels inspired the development of this extension. Additionally, by not blocking ads, the extension supports creators and channels, helping them continue to receive ad revenue while maintaining a pleasant experience for users.
